# Better Twitch Category (BTC)
Today I saw the new Twitch category layout and got annoyed the preview takes up half the screen. \
So, with that, I decided to improve Twitch's new category layout by hiding the preview when expanding the streamers list.

## Installing
You need to have an extension that can load userscripts installed. \
For firefox either install [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) \
For any chromium based browser (chrome/edge/vivaldi) install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
 
 Get the userscript from here (https://github.com/Pepijn98/better-twitch-category/raw/master/index.user.js) this should prompt you to an install screen.
